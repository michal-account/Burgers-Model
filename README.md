# Burgers-Model
Optimisation of the Burgers model parameters using the Monte Carlo method.
The aim of the project is to analyse the performance of a programme for numerically optimising the parameters of a Burgers model using the Monte Carlo method by random drawing. 
The Burgers model is a mathematical model that is used, among other things, to study the course and analysis of plastic deformation and how a material behaves under stress. 
The model is often used in the design of different types of structures or in numerical simulations.
One of the optimisation methods used in this project is the Monte Carlo method. 
The main task of such optimisation is to generate random values for given parameters and, from a given number of samples, select the best one, i.e. the one that is most satisfactory.
